## üîç Case Study ‚Äì Advanced Threat Investigation

- **Initial Attack Vector:** Phishing campaign delivering malicious Excel document (`A873564.xls`).  
- **Malware:** Trojan:O97M/Sadoca.C!ml & Ransom:Win32/WannaCrypt (`windows_update_tool.exe`).  
- **Lateral Movement:** PsExec exploitation targeting domain controller (`dc1.commensurate.tech`) under `www-data` user context.  
- **Persistence Mechanism:** Scheduled Task `Check for Updates` running `KB5011644.bin` every 5 minutes.  
- **Affected Systems:** `windows06.commensurate.tech`, `windows07.commensurate.tech`, `windows08.commensurate.tech`.  
- **Containment Actions:** Defender quarantined malicious files, email rule created to block `techforyou123.com` domain, network isolation of compromised endpoints.  
- **Key IOCs:** Malicious domain: `techforyou123.com`, Download URLs: `http://x1762z-ccl98b.ru/msupdate/KB5011644.bin`, File hashes from Sysmon logs, Scheduled Task: `Check for Updates`.
